## Packaging the Chaincode

Packaging in the context of smart contract development involves bundling multiple smart contract files and related resources into a deployable unit called a `chaincode` package. This package encapsulates the logic and functionality of the smart contracts, which are accessible and usable on a blockchain network after deployment. The packaging process often concludes with the creation of a compressed file format, such as `tar.gz`, to facilitate efficient distribution and deployment.

```bash
peer lifecycle chaincode package property.tgz --path ./contracts/ --lang golang --label property_1
```
